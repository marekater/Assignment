The prenatal diagnostic indications, fetal\\nultrasound, chromosome karyotype, peripheral blood CMA results of parents,\\npregnancy outcomes and follow-up of postnatal growth and development were\\nretrospectively analyzed.\\nRESULTS: Prenatal serological screening indicated 6 cases with high risk of\\ntrisomy 21, 1 case with nuchal fold (NF) thickening and 1 case of maternal\\nchromosomal balanced translocation. Fetal ultrasonography showed 1 case of NF\\nthickening, 1 case of fetal cerebral ventriculomegaly and 6 cases with normal\\nultrasound. CMA demonstrated that the size of duplication was between 651 kb and \\n3.26 Mb, and 22q11.2 duplication. Parents' CMA results revealed that 6 cases\\ninherited from one of the parents with normal phenotype, and the parents of 2\\ncases refused the CMA test. Two couples chose induced labor; 6 cases of continued\\npregnancy had normal phenotypes at birth. All 6 cases were followed up with\\nlongest of 3.5 years. The growth and psychological development were normal in 5\\ncases, and one case was growth retardation.\\nCONCLUSIONS: There were no specific clinical phenotypes in 22q11.2 duplication\\nsyndrome, and most of them were inherited from one parent who has normal\\nphenotype.\\n\\n\\nPMID: 31901048  [Indexed for MEDLINE]\\n\\n\\n2.

Although TD alone can cause WE, the high incidence in alcoholism suggests that TD and ethanol (EtOH) interact.</abstracttext>\\n<abstracttext label=\"METHODS\" nlmcategory=\"METHODS\">Mice in control, TD, or EtOH groups alone or combined were studied after 5 or 10\\xa0days of treatment. THAL and entorhinal cortex (ENT) histochemistry and mRNA were assessed.</abstracttext>\\n<abstracttext label=\"RESULTS\" nlmcategory=\"RESULTS\">Combined EtOH-TD treatment for 5\\xa0days (EtOH-TD5) showed activated microglia, proinflammatory gene induction and THAL neurodegeneration that was greater than that found with TD alone (TD5), whereas 10\\xa0days resulted in marked THAL degeneration and microglial-neuroimmune activation in both groups. In contrast, 10\\xa0days of TD did not cause ENT degeneration. Interestingly, in ENT, TD10 activated microglia and astrocytes more than EtOH-TD10. In THAL, multiple astrocytic markers were lost consistent with glial cell loss. TD blocks glucose metabolism more than acetate. Acetate derived from hepatic EtOH metabolism is transported by monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT) into both neurons and astrocytes that use acetyl-CoA synthetase (AcCoAS) to generate cellular energy from acetate. MCT and AcCoAS expression in THAL is lower than ENT prompting the hypothesis that focal THAL degeneration is related to insufficient MCT and AcCoAS in THAL. To test this hypothesis, we administered glycerin triacetate (GTA) to increase blood acetate and found it protected the THAL from TD-induced degeneration.</abstracttext>\\n<abstracttext label=\"CONCLUSIONS\" nlmcategory=\"CONCLUSIONS\">Our findings suggest that EtOH potentiates TD-induced THAL degeneration through neuroimmune gene induction. The findings support the hypothesis that TD deficiency inhibits global glucose metabolism and that a reduced ability to process acetate for cellular energy results in THAL focal degeneration in alcoholics contributing to the high incidence of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in alcoholism.</abstracttext>\\n<copyrightinformation>Copyright © 2013 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.</copyrightinformation>\\n</abstract>'"
